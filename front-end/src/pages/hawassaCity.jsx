              Perfectly poised at Lake Hawasa’s edge, the capital of the Sidama
              regional state is large, modern, well organized, and a bit of a
              shock to the system for those who’ve been slogging it through the
              Omo valley for a long time. A distance of 275 km from Addis Ababa
              It is bounded by Lake Hawassa on the west and north-west,
              Chelelaka swampy area on the east and south-east, Tikur Wuha River
              on the north, and Alamura Mountain on the south. Hawassa was
              founded in 1960 by Ras Mangesha Seyoum under the permission of
              Emperor Haile Selassie. In 1961, 404 pensioned soldiers, as well
              as their families, were provided with plots of land to settle in
              the eastern part of the town. This is reckoned to have given an
              impetus to the growth and development of the town. From 1960-1968,
              Hawassa served as the capital of a sub-administration of Yabella
              wereda, and it was designated the capital of the then Sidamo
              province in 1968.

              52.71% of the population said they were Protestants, 39.99%
              practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 7.30% were Muslim and
              3.78% embraced Catholicism.[14] The Latin Catholic minority is
              pastorally served by the missionary Apostolic Vicariate of Awasa,
              which has its Cathedral of Kidane-Meheret here.
